[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)
[![skills.sh](https://img.shields.io/badge/skills.sh-installable-green)](https://skills.sh/)

A collection of open-source agent skills installable via [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/).

Works with [Cursor](https://cursor.com/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (via AI extensions such as Claude Code and GitHub Copilot), [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/), and [Claude](https://claude.ai/) (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and other agents that load `SKILL.md` files).

## Install

Install interactively (shows a menu to pick skills):

```bash
npx skills add wanderlima/agent-skills
```

Install a specific skill:

```bash
npx skills add wanderlima/agent-skills@prepare-git-commit
npx skills add wanderlima/agent-skills@local-md-mermaid-pdf
npx skills add wanderlima/agent-skills@session-handoff
```

Install all skills globally:

```bash
npx skills add wanderlima/agent-skills --skill '*' -g -y
```

List available skills without installing:

```bash
npx skills add wanderlima/agent-skills -l
```

### Cursor

Install via [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) — skills land in `.agents/skills/` (project) or `~/.cursor/skills/` (global):

```bash
npx skills add wanderlima/agent-skills -a cursor -g
```

The CLI auto-detects Cursor when present. Installed skills are picked up automatically in Cursor chat.

### VS Code

VS Code uses whichever AI extension you have installed. Target that agent with `-a`:

**Claude Code** (VS Code extension):

```bash
npx skills add wanderlima/agent-skills -a claude-code -g
```

**GitHub Copilot**:

```bash
npx skills add wanderlima/agent-skills -a copilot -g
```

Without `-a`, the CLI tries to detect installed agents and may install to more than one. You can also browse and install from the editor using a [Skills.sh marketplace extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AbelMak.skills-sh) (works in VS Code, Cursor, and other VSIX-compatible editors).

### OpenClaw

Add the repository as a skill source in OpenClaw, or install individual skills from this repo. Skills with bundled dependencies (e.g. `local-md-mermaid-pdf`) include OpenClaw install metadata for required binaries.

### Claude

**Claude Code** (CLI or VS Code extension) — install via skills.sh:

```bash
npx skills add wanderlima/agent-skills -a claude-code -g
```

Or clone the repo and point Claude Code at the `skills/` directory.

**Other Claude clients** — copy a skill folder or reference its `SKILL.md` in your agent configuration.

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [prepare-git-commit](skills/prepare-git-commit/) | Workflow-only skill: stages related changes, writes `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG`, and hands off to the user for local `git commit` (hooks run on their machine) |
| [local-md-mermaid-pdf](skills/local-md-mermaid-pdf/) | Tool-dependent skill: converts Markdown with Mermaid charts to PDF using local tools (`mmdc`, `md-to-pdf`) |
| [session-handoff](skills/session-handoff/) | Workflow skill: creates a safe en-US handoff markdown file from the current session and saves it under the active workspace `handoffs/` folder |

## Repository structure

Each skill lives in its own folder under `skills/` with a `SKILL.md` file. See [docs/skill-anatomy.md](docs/skill-anatomy.md) for the full authoring guide — [`prepare-git-commit`](skills/prepare-git-commit/SKILL.md) and [`session-handoff`](skills/session-handoff/SKILL.md) are reference workflow-only skills; [`local-md-mermaid-pdf`](skills/local-md-mermaid-pdf/SKILL.md) is the reference tool-dependent skill.

## Development

From a skill folder:

```bash
cd skills/local-md-mermaid-pdf
./scripts/e2e.sh --diagnose   # environment check
./scripts/e2e.sh              # full pipeline
```

Verify skill discovery from the repo root:

```bash
npx skills add . -l
```
